Includes:

HOMEPAGE,

List View (One page): • Display a table of all users. • Include key information like name, user name, phone, and etc.

- Implement Advanced Filtering: Integrate a search feature that allows users to
filter the table by name, username, email, and phone. The displayed results
update dynamically as the user types in the search inputs for each
column.
- Use Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application.
- Use TypeScript comprehensively across the entire web application to ensure
proper typing and reduce potential runtime errors. This includes all aspects of
the application’s functionality.
- Use Material UI (React component library) to design the table and search inputs to be user-friendly and visually appealing. 

Technical Considerations: 
- React and TypeScript for building the components and managing state. 
- Redux toolkit as a state manager and loading data from mock API. 
- Material UI components for styling application.
